        <p>Leny Yoro is set to be announced as a new Manchester United player this week.</p>
        <p>According to a report by David Ornstein, Leny Yoro flew from Lille to Manchester this morning to undergo medical examinations before he signs the official contract with Man United. The 18-year-old showcased his defensive skills last season with Les Dougues and now he is set to join Manchester United on a €62 million transfer, with a chance to increase to €70 million with add-ons built into the deal.</p>
        <p>United have already agreed personal terms with the player. A 5-year contract with an option to extend for an additional year will be on the table for Yoro to sign today or tomorrow.</p>
        <p>After securing the services of Joshua Zirkzee who became the first player to be brought in following the INEOS takeover, Yoro’s arrival sends a clear message to the fans and other Premier League clubs that The Red Devils mean business for this upcoming season.</p>
        <p>Erik Ten Hag’s club is expected to sign another central defender as they lost Raphael Varane and Willy Kambwala after the end of the last campaign.</p>
